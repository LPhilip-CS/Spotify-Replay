Welcome to the World Life Expectancy Project. A comprehensive analysis of global demographic data to understand and interpret trends in life expectancy across different regions and populations. 
This project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing life expectancy, identify patterns, temporal trends, correlation analysis, and present findings through dynamic visualizations to enhance understanding. 

Below is a brief overview to help you navigate through the project:

## Project Objective:
- Understand the factors influencing life expectancy worldwide.
- Identify patterns, correlations, and outliers in life expectancy data.
- Provide valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers.

## Dataset:
- The dataset includes life expectancy data for various countries.
- Key variables include Status, GDP, BMI, mortality rates, and more.
- Access the dataset through the 'WorldLifeExpectancy.xlsx' or the 'DatabaseScript.sql' file.

## Project Structure:
Data Cleaning:
- Find the data cleaning script in the 'DataCleaning.sql' file.
- Addresses missing values, and outliers, and standardizes formats.
- Ensure data integrity and format consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Focuses on extracting meaningful insights from the dataset using SQL queries. 
- Discover trends and relationships between attributes.
- Aggregate data over time to observe temporal trends in life expectancy.
- Explore correlations between life expectancy and other variables using the correlation coefficient (if applicable).


Visualization:
- Utilize Excel charts, such as line charts, bar graphs, and scatter plots, to represent variations in life expectancy over time or across different variables.
- Further, explore and analyze trends in tableau with a fully dynamic map system.
- Include interactive dashboards using features like slicers, pivot tables, maps, and more.
- These dashboards enhance the user experience by allowing dynamic data exploration.


## Answering Questions:
- Which top 5 countries have the highest average life expectancy?
- Is there a drastic change in life expectancy (2007-2022) worldwide?
- Is there a correlation between life expectancy and a country's status (developed vs. developing)?
- What are the overall mortality rates among the age ranges in the United States?




## Working in SQL:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Import the dataset from the 'WorldLifeExpectancy.csv' or run 'DatabaseScript.sql' to manually populate the database.
- Run the files in sequential order: DatabaseScript, DataCleaning, and ExploratoryAnalysis.

## Working in Excel/Tableau:
- Explore the 'WorldLifeExpectancy.xlsx' file for interactive charts and graphs.
- Open the 'WorldLifeExpectancy.twbx' file to view the tableau dashboard.
- Leverage Excel/Tableau functions and tools for further analysis.
- Communicate findings effectively through visual representation and come up with insights and conclusions.

## Feedback and Support:
- Share your feedback, suggestions, or report issues.
- Thank you for contributing to the World Life Expectancy Project! Together, we can unravel valuable insights for a healthier global future.
