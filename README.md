This repository contains the code and analysis for exploring and gaining insights from a Spotify dataset. The dataset provides information about tracks, artists, user preferences, streams and more, collected from the Spotify platform. 

Below is a brief overview to help you navigate through the project:

## Project Objective:
- Understand the factors influencing life expectancy worldwide.
- Identify patterns, correlations, and outliers in life expectancy data.
- Provide valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers.

## Dataset:
- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023)
- The dataset includes life expectancy data for various countries.
- Key variables include Status, GDP, BMI, mortality rates, and more.
- Access the dataset through the 'WorldLifeExpectancy.xlsx' or the 'DatabaseScript.sql' file.

## Project Structure:
Data Cleaning:
- Find the data cleaning script in the 'DataCleaning.sql' file.
  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Focuses on extracting meaningful insights from the dataset using SQL queries. 
- Discover trends and relationships between attributes.
- Aggregate data over time to observe temporal trends in life expectancy.
- Explore correlations between life expectancy and other variables using the correlation coefficient (if applicable).


Visualization:
- Utilize Excel charts, such as line charts, bar graphs, and scatter plots, to represent variations in life expectancy over time or across different variables.
- Further, explore and analyze trends in tableau with a fully dynamic map system.
- Include interactive dashboards using features like slicers, pivot tables, maps, and more.
- These dashboards enhance the user experience by allowing dynamic data exploration.


## Answering Questions:
- What are the top 5 highest streamed songs and artists of all time?
- Is there a difference in total daily streams?
- Is there a correlation between song elements (danceability, speechiness, etc...) and the popularity of the song?
- Which month has the highest number of tracks released? Highest average stream?

## Working in SQL:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Import the dataset from the 'WorldLifeExpectancy.csv' or run 'DatabaseScript.sql' to manually populate the database.
- Run the files in sequential order: DatabaseScript, DataCleaning, and ExploratoryAnalysis.

## Working in Excel/Tableau:
- Explore the 'WorldLifeExpectancy.xlsx' file for interactive charts and graphs.
- Open the 'WorldLifeExpectancy.twbx' file to view the tableau dashboard.
- Leverage Excel/Tableau functions and tools for further analysis.
- Communicate findings effectively through visual representation and come up with insights and conclusions.

## Feedback and Support:
- Share your feedback, suggestions, or report issues.
- Thank you for contributing to the World Life Expectancy Project! Together, we can unravel valuable insights for a healthier global future.
