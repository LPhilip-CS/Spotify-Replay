This repository contains the code and analysis for exploring and gaining insights from a Spotify dataset. 

Below is a brief overview to help you navigate through the project:

## Project Objective:
- Understand the factors influencing life expectancy worldwide.
- Identify patterns, and correlations, in user listening preferences.

## Answering Questions:
- What are the top 5 highest streamed songs and artists of all time?
- Is there a difference in total daily streams?
- Is there a correlation between song elements (danceability, speechiness, etc...) and the popularity of the song?
- Which month has the highest number of tracks released? Highest average stream?

## Dataset:
- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023)
- The dataset provides information about tracks, artists, user preferences, streams, and more, collected from the Spotify platform. 
- Access the dataset through the 'Spotify replay RAW.xlsx' file.

## Project Structure:
Data Cleaning:
- All the data cleaning was done within the Power query editor within Power BI.
- Including correcting errors, standardizing column formats, and nullifying missing values.
- Establish relationships between different tables in the dataset (Calendar).
  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Focuses on extracting meaningful insights from the dataset using power query.
- Discover trends and relationships between attributes and elements of music.
- Aggregate data over time to observe popular trends among tracks, artists, and albums.
- Explore correlations between life expectancy and other variables using the correlation coefficient (if applicable).

Visualization:
- Explore the 'Spotify Replay.pbix' file for interactive charts and graphs by exporting the 'Spotify replay RAW.xlsx' file.
